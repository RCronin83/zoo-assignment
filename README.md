#Assignment 'Zoo Objects'
Completed by Ryan Cronin on 3/21/2017

Creating, throwing and catching errors for constructors and methods.

Take our Zoo constructors and methods from the previous assignment and add some proper Errors to them. Any time something occurs that wasn't expected, let's throw an Error. In our tests, we must then try our code and catch our Errors.

School: The Iron Yard

Instructor: Jordan Kasper

This is an assignment for writing classes, constructor functions and methods.
By the end of this assignment you should be able to create a new type of object
along with child objects that have shared functionality through their prototypes.

We're going to create a Zoo. Our zoo has lots of different animals, many of
which share various properties and actions. We will have a base Animal with some
shared functionality, then a few species of animals with specific functionality.
