Instructor: Jordan Kasper

This is an assignment for writing classes, constructor functions and methods.
By the end of this assignment you should be able to create a new type of object
along with child objects that have shared functionality through their prototypes.

We're going to create a Zoo. Our zoo has lots of different animals, many of
which share various properties and actions. We will have a base Animal with some
shared functionality, then a few species of animals with specific functionality.
